## Graph:
####Graphs in data structures are non-linear data structures made up of a finite number of nodes or vertices and the edges that connect them.
Edges may be directed or non directed (2 way street).

1. Maps - When we want to find the quickest route from A to B when multiple routes exist.
2. Social Network - How many friends in my social network.
3. Resource allocation/Scheduling - N process and M resources, best way to map.
4. GraphQL leverages the power of graph data structures by modeling the business problem as a graph within its schema.
